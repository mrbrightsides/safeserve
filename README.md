## 🚨 The Challenge: The "MBG Crisis"

In 2025, Indonesia's historic **Makan Bergizi Gratis (MBG)** program—aiming to feed 83 million beneficiaries—faced a critical operational challenge. Fragmented oversight of hyper-local vendors (UMKM) led to significant food safety blind spots.

**SafeServe** is a centralized, AI-powered food safety intelligence platform designed to replace reactive damage control with **proactive detection and immutable governance**.

## 💡 The Solution: Unified Safety Ecosystem

SafeServe connects Schools, Vendors, and the Government (BGN/BPOM) in a real-time safety loop:

### 1. 🏛️ Regulator Dashboard (National Oversight)
*   **System Simulation Mode**: Trigger and manage "Outbreak Scenarios" to test regional response readiness.
*   **AI Explainability**: Deep "Reasoning Chains" that explain *why* a vendor is flagged as high-risk using Gemini 3.1 Reasoning.
*   **Regional Pulse**: Live geographical risk heatmaps powered by **Google Search Grounding**.
*   **AI Intelligence Briefings**: Profile-integrated status synthesis for quick administrative decision-making.

### 2. 🚚 Vendor Portal (Catering / UMKM)
*   **Multimodal Hygiene Audit**: Computer vision analysis of preparation areas to ensure BPOM compliance.
*   **Advanced Traceability**: Searchable, filterable blockchain-verified inventory ledger (Poultry, Grains, Vegetables).
*   **Staff Wellness Ledger**: Biometric health check-ins (temperature & symptoms) required for shift clearance.
*   **IoT Cold-Chain**: Real-time telemetry monitoring for refrigeration stability.

### 3. 🏫 School Portal (Teachers / Admins)
*   **SOS Emergency Reporting**: Instant symptom-cluster reporting with AI-driven severity triage (1-10 index).
*   **Nutrition Compliance Gauge**: Real-time menu analysis ensuring caloric and micronutrient targets are met.
*   **Vendor Dossier**: One-click transparency into an assigned vendor's safety grade, audit milestones, and integrity proofs.

### 4. 🍃 Sustainability & Waste Portal (Governance)
*   **Active Governance Mode**: Automated AI policy adjustment loop based on district consumption curves.
*   **Simulation Delta Panel**: Monte Carlo modeling of policy impacts on CO₂ offsets and meal recovery.
*   **Inefficiency Benchmarking**: Data-driven ranking of vendor waste variance to optimize resource allocation.

## 🚀 Advanced AI Implementation

SafeServe utilizes the full spectrum of the **Google Gemini API**:
- **Reasoning Models**: Leveraging `gemini-3.1-flash-reasoning` for complex risk triage and evidence synthesis.
- **Search Grounding**: Injecting real-world news and regional stability data into risk models via the `googleSearch` tool.
- **Structured Intelligence**: Rigid `responseSchema` implementation for deterministic JSON data flows in audit dossiers.
- **Resilient Engineering**: Built-in **Circuit Breaker** and **Exponential Backoff** logic for robust performance during peak loads.

## 🛡️ Security & Integrity
*   **Security Vault**: Layered defense including MFA, Biometric Signatures, and AES-256 session encryption.
*   **Root Key Rotation**: Administrative ability to rotate digital signatures for the national ledger.
*   **Deep Cluster Scans**: Automated integrity checks for node synchronization across Jakarta and regional hubs.

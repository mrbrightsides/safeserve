## 🚨 The Challenge: The "MBG Crisis"
In 2025, Indonesia's historic **Makan Bergizi Gratis (MBG)** program—aiming to feed 83 million beneficiaries—faced a critical operational challenge. Fragmented oversight of hyper-local vendors (UMKM) led to significant food safety blind spots. 

**SafeServe** is a centralized, AI-powered food safety intelligence platform designed to replace reactive damage control with **proactive detection and immutable governance**.

## 💡 The Unified Safety Ecosystem

SafeServe creates a "Trust-Loop" between Schools, Vendors, and the Government (BGN/BPOM):

### 🏛️ Regulator Dashboard (National Oversight)
* **Outbreak Simulation Mode**: A "War Room" interface to trigger and manage regional response readiness.
* **AI Explainability**: Deep "Reasoning Chains" that explain *why* a vendor is flagged as high-risk using **Gemini 2.0/3.1 Reasoning**.
* **Regional Pulse**: Live geographical risk heatmaps enriched by **Google Search Grounding** to monitor local news & outbreaks.

### 🚚 Vendor Portal (Catering / UMKM)
* **Multimodal Hygiene Audit**: AI vision analysis of preparation areas to ensure BPOM compliance.
* **Advanced Traceability**: Searchable, blockchain-verified inventory ledger for raw ingredients.
* **IoT Cold-Chain**: Real-time telemetry monitoring for refrigeration stability with automated alerts.

### 🏫 School Portal (Teachers / Admins)
* **SOS Emergency Reporting**: Instant symptom-cluster reporting with AI-driven severity triage (1-10 index).
* **Nutrition Compliance**: Real-time menu analysis ensuring caloric and micronutrient targets are met.
* **Vendor Dossier**: One-click transparency into an assigned vendor's safety grade and audit history.

---

## 🧠 Advanced AI Implementation (Google Gemini API)

SafeServe leverages the cutting edge of Generative AI to ensure national safety:

* **Reasoning Models**: Utilizes `gemini-2.0-flash-thinking` for complex risk triage and evidence synthesis.
* **Search Grounding**: Injecting real-world news and regional stability data via the `googleSearch` tool.
* **Structured Intelligence**: Rigid `responseSchema` implementation for deterministic JSON data flows.
* **Resilient Engineering**: Built-in **Circuit Breaker** and **Exponential Backoff** logic for 99.9% API uptime.
